Create the following demo application:
- right-click on the stage causes a new list-window
to appear at the point of click
- the list-window is an input widget. typing
causes narrowing of available options
- among the options, there should be 'add button'
option, that causes the creation of a new button
on the stage
- left-click on the button causes the invocation
of the action (which is by default opening the
button's editor window)
- right-click on the button causes the option list
to appear. among the option list there are the following:
* edit action ...
* appearance ...
* delete

- ctrl+click on any object causes a highlight of that
object. pressing delete when an object is highlited
causes deletion of that object
