List of things to do:
input.c:
- support for the remaining event types in scm_from_sdl_event
(or maybe just give it up? simplify?)
- write a set of appropriate functions to generate events

image.c
- conversion functions image->array and array->image

slayer.c
- save the structure of the stage to the .spec file

widgets.c
- extract the scheme code to some external file that should
be somehow incorporated into the binary, or distributed as
a module (it would be nice if the guile itself could be
made a self-contained executable as well, with no need
for any external files)

sound.c, font.c, timer.c
- create/add d(^_^)b
