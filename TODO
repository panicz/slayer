List of things to do:
input.c:
- support for the remaining event types in scm_from_sdl_event
(or emaybe just give it up? simplify?)
- write a set of appropriate functions to generate events

image.c
- conversion functions image->array and array->image

slayer.c
- save the structure of the stage to the .spec file

widgets.c
- extract the scheme code to some external file that should
be somehow incorporated into the binary, or distributed as
a module (it would be nice if the guile itself could be
made a self-contained executable as well, with no need
for any external files. It would also be nice if one could
dump the memory state to file, and load it back from there)
- create textarea widget (and attach it to guile interpreter)
- create a menu widget (and associate it with creating
new buttons)

sound.c, font.c, timer.c
- create/add d(^_^)b



GUILE IDEAS (r8rs?)
- procedure introspection: the meta-procedures
procedure-source, procedure-arity 

- environment introspection -- the environment's display procedue should
display all the definitions that would be necessary to obtain the current
state of the program

- programmable reader, and especially the possibility of defining new
syntaxes for various parentheses, like [], {} and <>
