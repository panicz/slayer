In order to run the ode.scm demo, you'll need to build the scum physics module,
which requires Open Dynamics Engine (http://www.ode.org/) and g++ 4 compiler
(to support the c++0x language standard)

If these preconditions are satisfied, it should be sufficient to type "make"
in this (i.e. "demos") directory.

Running the remaining demos requires only that slayer is build in the "src"
directory. There's no need to "make install". To run e.g. pong.scm, just type
"./pong.scm"
