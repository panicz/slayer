SLAYER NEWS
===========

- 1.0.0

	This is the first release of slayer. It comes bundled with
	GNU autotools. The environment statically enables certain
	features from SDL, i.e. the ones provided by SDL_image, SDL_ttf
	and SDL_mixer -- thus, those libraries are required to build
	slayer. This should change in the future, and they should become
	available as loadable modules that are built separately.
