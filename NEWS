SLAYER NEWS
===========

- 1.1.0

	With this edition, the support for Windows was dropped, because
	it turned out to be difficult to maintain, since the code started
	to use some more advanced OpenGL features.
	The most important change in the framework itself is that it
	now allows rendering to textures through "call-with-video-output-to",
	and that it tries to allocate all images in hardware. Besides,
	the low-level support for storing and setting key bindings was added.

- 1.0.0

	This is the first release of slayer. It comes bundled with
	GNU autotools. The environment statically enables certain
	features from SDL, i.e. the ones provided by SDL_image, SDL_ttf
	and SDL_mixer -- thus, those libraries are required to build
	slayer. This should change in the future, and they should become
	available as loadable modules that are built separately.
