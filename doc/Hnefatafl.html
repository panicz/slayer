<p>These were the accomplishments of the noble of Viking Age Scandinavia.
 Before the introduction of <b>Chess </b>(Old Norse <i>Skak-Tafl</i>)
in the XIth and XIIth centuries, Scandinavians sharpened their
wits by playing a game known as <i>Tafl </i><a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#2">[2]</a>.  Tafl in Old
Norse means "table" and by the end of the period referred
to a variety of board games, such as Chess (<i>Skak-Tafl </i>or
"check-table"), <b>Tabula </b>(the medieval ancestor
of Backgammon, introduced from the French as <i>Quatre </i>and
thus <i>Kvatru-Tafl </i><a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#3">[3]</a>), <b>Fox and Geese </b>(<i>Ref-Skak,
</i>"fox chess", <i>Hala-Tafl </i>or <i>Freys-Tafl</i>),
<b>Three Men's Morris </b>(<i>Hr&#230;_-Tafl </i>"Quick-Tafl"
<a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#4">[4]</a>) and <b>Nine Men's Morris </b><a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#5">[5]</a>.  However, the term Tafl
was most commonly used to refer to a game known as <i>Hnefa-Tafl
</i>or "King's Table" <a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#6">[6]</a>.  Hnefatafl was known in Scandinavia
before 400 A. D. and was carried by the Vikings to Greenland,
Iceland, Ireland, Britain, Wales and as far east as the Ukraine.
 The Saxons had their own variant, derived from a common Germanic
Tafl game, which was apparently the only board game known to them
prior to the introduction of Chess <a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#7">[7]</a>.</p>


<h2>COMPONENTS</h2>

<h3><i>Board</i></h3>

<p>Hnefatafl and its numerous variants were played on odd-sized boards
as small as 7 x 7 and as large as 19 x 19.  Usually wooden, they
sometimes had holes drilled in the center of each playing square,
the pieces being pegged -this made for easy storage or even for
traveling boards.  Most boards had the starting positions of the
pieces marked in two distinct patterns to facilitate setting up.
 In some cases, the board is drawn Go-style, the pieces standing
at the intersections of the lines rather than at the centers of
the squares.  The board itself is sometimes mentioned as <i>Tafl
</i>or <i>Tann-Tafl </i><a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#8">[8]</a> ("tooth-table," a Tafl-board
inlaid with walrus ivory).</p>

<p>A beautiful carved board with 13x13 squares was found at Gokstad
in Norway.  This is a double sided board with a Nine Men's Morris
layout carved on the reverse side as with other less impressive
examples.  Many other wooden Tafl boards have also been found
throughout the Viking and Anglo-Saxon world, but some of the boards
were much simpler affairs being only marked out with charcoal
or scratched onto the surface of slices of rock.</p>

<p>The Scottish (<b>Ard-Ri, </b>"High King") and Irish
(<b>Fidchell, Fitchneal </b>or <b>Fithcheall</b>) variants were
both played on a seven by seven board, with slightly different
starting layouts.  Fitchneal is mentioned in the <i>Mabinogion
</i>and in <i>Cormac's Glossary </i>(IXth century); the descriptions
are scanty, so there is an element of speculation in assigning
these games to the Hnefatafl family.  <b>Tablut, </b>the Finnish
variant, was played on a nine by nine board.</p>

<p>Hnefatafl, the Norse variant, was played either on an eleven by
eleven board or a thirteen by thirteen board.</p>

<p><b>Tawlbyund </b>(or <b>Tawl Bwrdd, </b>"Throw Board"),
the Welsh variant, was played on an eleven by eleven board.  It
dates back at least to the Xth century.  The Welsh also played
the seven by seven Irish game of Fitchneal, which they called
<b>Gwyddbwyll.</b></p>

</center><p></p>

<p><b>Alea Evangelii</b>, finally, was the Saxon variant and used
a nineteen by nineteen board -it was apparently the only board
game played by the Saxons.  It takes its modern name from the
opening line of the Xth century manuscript it is documented by:
<i>"Incipit alea evangelii quam Dubinsi&#8230;".</i></p>

<p> Some commentators suggest that this arrangement represents a
sea-battle, with a King's ship defended by twenty-four white ships
and a fleet of forty-eight dark attackers.</p>

<h3><i>Dice</i></h3>

<p>The game was sometimes played with dice (Tawlbyund, for example),
which would either indicate the maximum distance a piece could
move or whether the player could move at all or not (move on an
odd roll, miss a turn on an even roll).  The Irish called the
dice variant <b>Brandubh</b>.  As a true game of skill, Hnefatafl
is best played without dice <a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#9">[9]</a>.</p>

<h3><i>Pieces</i></h3>

<p>The King piece was called <i>Hnefi </i>("King", Old
English has <i>Cyningstan </i>"King-Stone"); the pieces
<i>Hunns </i>("knobs"), <i>T&#230;flor </i>("table-men")<i>
</i>or <i>T&#230;felstanas </i>(Old English "table-men").<i></i></p><i>

</i><p><i> </i>The Lapps call their Tablut pieces "Swedes" and
"Muscovites" (they were very similar to modern stylized
chessmen, the Swedish King resembling a King, the Swedish Hunns
pawns and the Muscovites bent rooks).  They sometimes had pegged
bottoms that fit in holes drilled in the board.  The King was
bigger and more ornate.</p>

<p>With the larger boards (e.g. Alea Evangelii), the King's pieces
were sometimes differentiated, with a small, elite "King's
Guard" of uncapturable pieces.</p>

<p>There are many finds of board games and gaming pieces from Scandinavia
and from the British Isles.  Gaming pieces were often hemispherical
and made of antler, amber, bone, clay, glass, horn, stone, jet,
wood or even horses' teeth <a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#10">[10]</a>.  Finds of several light and several
dark pieces together have been made sometimes with a single piece
being a different shape, like a sea urchin, in the same area.</p>

<p>For 9x9 boards, sixteen dark pieces surrounded eight light pieces
with an additional King.  Boards with more squares typically had
twelve light pieces and a King facing twenty-four dark pieces.
 The colors were often switched.</p>

<h2>SET-UP</h2>

<p>The King (large white piece) goes on the central square (Throne
-<i>Konakis </i>in Finnish), surrounded by his men (other white
pieces).  The enemy (black) pieces are set up around the edges
of the board.  Black moves first -except in the case of Alea Evangelii,
where White moves first.</p>

<h2>PLAYING HNEFATAFL</h2>

<p>Turns alternate between the players.</p>

<p>All pieces move in the same way, like modern rooks at Chess. 
That is, on his turn, a player may slide a single piece of his
color any number of squares in either orthogonal direction (up-down
or left-right, no diagonal moves) as long as it doesn't jump over
another piece of either color.  The Throne and the four corner
squares are off-limits to all pieces except the King.  With the
smaller board variants, pieces of either color may pass over the
Throne; with the larger board variants, only the King may do so.</p>

<p>The White player is trying to have his King escape his assailants
by reaching a corner square.  If the White player moves so that
his King ends up with a clear path to any of the four corner squares,
he must announce that he has an escape route open.  The Lapps
use the word <i>Raichi </i>("Check") to announce a single
route and <i>Tuichi </i>("Checkmate") to announce a
double route.  On his next turn, if he can still do so, the King
may be moved to a corner square and escape.  White then wins.</p>

<p> If the Black player inadvertently opens an escape route for the
King, the White player may take advantage of it immediately!</p>

<p>If the moved piece ends up sandwiching an opposing piece between
itself and another piece of the moving color or a corner square,
the sandwiched piece is removed from the board.  This is called
<i>custodial capture.  </i>It is possible to capture several pieces
in a single move.</p>

	</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</center><p></p>

<p>The King must be sandwiched along both axes to be captured.  The
Throne, corners and edges count as Black pieces for purposes of
sandwiching the King, so Black needs only three pieces to capture
the King on the edge of the board or if he is right beside his
Throne, two if the King is right beside a corner square.  When
the King is in danger of being captured on Black's next move,
he must announce "Watch your King" to the White player
(this is reminiscent of Chess' prohibition against moving one's
King into check).  Black wins by capturing the King.  The King
can also be captured if he and no more than one defender are surrounded
on all sides and incapable of moving.</p>

<h2>WINNER</h2>

<p>The winner is the White player if he manages to reach a corner
square with his King, the Black player if he manages to capture
the King.  Because the game is uneven, it is good etiquette to
play two games, switching sides.  Each player keeps track of how
many pieces he lost or took from his opponent and this score is
used to determine the ultimate winner.</p>

<h2>VARIANTS</h2>

With the smaller boards, a different game is played if the pieces
can only move one square at a time.  With the larger boards, the
King is allowed to escape by simply reaching any edge square rather
than a corner square.  Optionally, a piece may <i>not </i>move
to place itself in sandwich between two opposing pieces without
being captured.  Finally, an element of chance can be introduced
by the use of dice, as described earlier.

<h2>STRATEGY</h2>

<p>The King's forces usually possess a slight advantage, despite
being outnumbered.  Tactically, the defender (King's men) must
arrange for the King to escape the board.  Therefore, the defender
should try to capture as many attackers as possible to clear an
escape route, while not trying too hard to protect his own men
since they, too, can block the King's escape.  The attacker's
object is not only to prevent the King's escape, but also to capture
him.  The best way to do this is to avoid making captures early
in the game, instead scattering the attackers to block possible
escape routes.<a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#11">[11]</a></p>

<h2>HISTORY</h2>

<p>Hnefatafl started to decline in the XIth century with the rise
of Chess.  It disappeared from Wales in the late XVIth century
and from Lappland in the early XVIIIth.</p>

<p>Although the recorded rules are all post-period, there are no
significant differences between variants of widely separate geographic
location.  We owe the record of Tablut to the diary of the young
Linnaeus, the Swedish botanist, who visited Lappland in 1732.</p>

<p>Writings of the times mention various board games but it can be
quite difficult to work out exactly how the game was played. 
Among the many names for games known from literature we have Brannan-Tafl,
Hala-Tafl, Hnefa-Tafl, Hnot-Tafl, Hr&#230;_-Tafl, Kvatru-Tafl
and Skak-Tafl, although the rules for many of these remain unclear.</p>
 
<p>In any case the rules may have differed from place to place.</p>

<p>There are many references to Hnefatafl in Old Norse literature,
from sources ranging from the poems of the <i>Poetic Edda </i>to
saga references such as <i>Orkneyinga Saga, </i>the Greenland
<i>Lay of Atli, Hervarar Saga, Fridthjof's Saga </i>and more.</p>
 
<p>Most frequently these references are to the game pieces.</p>

<p>The earliest mention of the game appears in Voluspa 60 <a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#12">[12]</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Then in the grass the golden t&#230;flor, the far-famed ones,
will be found again, which they had owned in older days.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rigsthula speaks of the noble child Earl learning to swim and
play Tafl <a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#13">[13]</a>.  From <i>Hervarar Saga </i><a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#14">[14]</a> come two riddles
in the riddle-game between Odinn and King Heidrek:</p>

<blockquote><p>Who are the maids that fight weaponless around their lord, the
brown ever sheltering and the fair ever attacking him?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answer: the pieces in Hnefatafl (in this case the brown pieces
occupy the center, attacked by the white pieces).  And:</p>

<blockquote><p>What is that beast all girdled with iron which kills the flocks?<br>
It has eight horns but no head?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answer: the Hnefi or King.  We know that women also played Hnefatafl
from the reference in <i>Gunnlaug's Saga Ormstunga </i>in which
Gunnlaug plays Tafl with Helga Thorsteinsdatter, the granddaughter
of Egil Skallagrimsson <a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#15">[15]</a>.  <i>Fridthjof's Saga Ins Fraeki </i><a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#16">[16]</a>
has a game between Fridthjof and Bjorn, where comments ostensibly
made about the game are actually answers to King Helgi's man Hilding:</p>

<blockquote><p>But as their troops seemed but few to them, they sent Hilding,
their foster-father, to Fridthjof, and asked him to join the troops
of the kings.  Fridthjof was sitting at Tafl when Hilding came.</p>

<p>He said: "Our kings send word to thee, and they would have
thy fighting men for the war against King Hring, who wishes to
fall upon their kingdom wrongfully and tyrannously".  Fridthjof
made no answer, but said to Bjorn, with whom he was playing, "That
is a weak point, brother: But thou needest not change it.  Rather
will I move against the red piece to know if it is protected".</p>

<p>Hilding spoke again: "King Helgi bade me tell thee, Fridthjof,
that thou shouldst go on this raid, else thou wilt suffer hardship
when they come back".  Bjorn said, "Thou hast a choice
of two moves, brother: two ways of saving it".  Fridthjof
said, "First it would be wise to move against this Hnefi
and that will be an easy choice".  Hilding received no other
answer to his errand.  He went back quickly to the kings and told
them of Fridthjof.  They asked Hilding what sense he made of these
words.  Hilding said: "When he spoke of the weak point, he
meant this raid of your; and when he said he would move with the
fair piece, that must refer to your sister Ingebjorg.  Therefore
look to her well.  And when I promised him hardship from you,
Bjorn called that a choice, but Fridthjof said that the Hnefi
had first to be attacked, and by that he meant King Hring".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Several things are lacking in these brief references: the arrangement
of the board, initial placement of the playing pieces, and the
rules of the game.  Archaeology provides some additional clues.</p>

<p>There have been numerous grave finds of game pieces.  One runestone
from Ockelbo, Sweden, shows two men balancing a boardgame on their
knees, which reflects the saga references where arguments over
the game frequently cause one or both players to leap to their
feet, upsetting the Tafl-board and scattering the pieces [<a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#17">17</a>,
<a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#18">18</a>].  Fragments of actual game boards have been excavated as well.</p>

<p>One board from the Gokstad ship has a 15 x 15 ruled board on
one side for Tafl, and what appears to be a Nine Men's Morris
board on the reverse side <a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#19">[19]</a>.  A magnificent Tafl board thought
to have been manufactured on the Isle of Man was found in a crannog
excavation in Ballinderry, West Meath, Ireland <a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#20">[20]</a>.</p>

<p>Archaeologists had long recognized the similarities of these boards
to those used for Fox and Geese, but this was not enough to reconstruct
the Viking Age game.  Further clues were provided by an English
manuscript from King &#198;thelstan's court (c. 925-940 A.&nbsp;D.)
which describes a game known as <i>Alea Evangelii</i>, which attempts
to give the board and the arrangement of the pieces upon it scriptural
significance as a harmony of the gospels <a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#21">[21]</a>.  Again, no rules
for movement of the men are given, but the manuscript provides
a diagram showing the initial arrangement of the game pieces.</p>

<p>Robert ap Ifan in 1587 described <a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#22">[22]</a> Tawl-bwrdd as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>The above board must be played with a King in the center and twelve
men in the places next to him; and twenty-four lie in wait to
capture him.  These are placed, six in the center of every end
of the board and in the six central places.  Two players move
the pieces, and if one belonging to the King comes between the
attackers, he is dead and is thrown out of the play; and if one
of the attackers comes between two of the King's men, the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The final clue to reconstructing the rules of Hnefatafl was provided
in 1732 by Linnaeus, the Swedish botanist, in his diary of his
travels among the Lapps (<i>Lachesis Lapponica</i>).  In the entry
for 20 July 1732, Linnaeus described <a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#23">[23]</a> a game known among the
Lapps as <i>Tablut, </i>which is a derivative of Hnefatafl:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Tablut board is marked out with 9 x 9 squares, the central
one being distinctive and known as Konakis or throne.  Only the
Swedish king can occupy this square.  One player gas eight blonde
Swedes and their monarch; the other has sixteen dark Muscovites.</p>

<p>The king is larger than the other pieces.  The Muscovites are
placed on the embroidered squares. (The board was made of reindeer
skin ornamented with needlework as the Lapps had no cloth).  Rules:</p>

<p>1. All the pieces move orthogonally any number of vacant squares
(the move of the rook in Chess).</p>

<p>2. A piece is captured and removed from the board when the opponent
occupies both adjacent squares in a row or column.  This is the
custodian method of capture.  A piece may move safely onto an
empty square between two enemy pieces.</p>

<p>3. The king is captured if all four squares around him are occupied
by enemy pieces; or if he is surrounded on three sides by enemy
pieces and on the fourth by the Konakis.  When the king is captured,
the game is over and the Muscovites are victorious.</p>

<p>4. The Swedes win if the king reaches any square on the periphery
of the board.  When there is a clear route for the king to a perimeter
square the player must warn his opponent by saying "Raichi!"
 When there are two clear routes he must say "Tuichi!"
 This is the equivalent of "checkmate" since it is impossible
to block two directions in the same move.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>THE ROMAN CONNECTION</h2>

<p>Hnefatafl may be related to the Roman game of <b>Ludus Latrunculorum
</b>("The Game of Soldiers", <b>Latrunculi </b>for short).</p>

<p>During the Roman era, the Persians played a game known as <b>Nard
</b>which may have been identical to Latrunculi.  It should not
be confused with the unrelated medieval Nard, which is a member
of the Backgammon family.</p>

<p>Many Latrunculi boards were found in Roman Britain, including
some near Hadrian's Wall, dating back to between the IInd and
IVth centuries.  The theory is that the Celts picked it up from
the Romans and modified it.  Their key innovation was to make
the game uneven, with one side trying to escape the other.</p>

<p>The Latrunculi boards found vary somewhat in size: 7x8, 8x8 and
9x10.  The number of playing pieces found with them also varies;
there seems to have been simply a lot of them -Juvenal uses the
word "mandra", which simply means "cattle herd".</p>

<p>Ludus Latrunculorum is first mentioned by Varro (116-27 B.C.)
but is probably much older.  It may in fact be in turn a descendant
of the Ancient Greek games of <b>Penta Grammai </b>and <b>Petteia.</b></p><b>

</b><p><b></b>Latrunculi are last mentioned by Macrobius around 400 A.
D., when he rebukes those that "played at Tabula and Latrunculi".</p>

<p>Oddly, Latrunculi does not seem to have been played by the Byzantines.</p>

<p>Ovid tells us that the pieces were of different colored glass,
sometimes precious stones.  He also states that a piece is taken
by custodial capture and that "backward moves" were
allowed.  Our chief source, however, is an obscure account in
a poem known as <i>Laus Pisonis </i>which was written by Saleius
Bassus during the middle of the Ist century A. D.:</p>

<blockquote><p>Cunningly the pieces are disposed on the open board and battles
are fought with soldiery of glass, so that now White blocks Black,
now Black blocks White.  But every foe yields to thee, Piso; marshaled
by thee, what piece ever gave way?  What piece on the brink of
death dealt not death to his enemy?  Thousand-fold are thy battle
tactics: one man in fleeing from an attack himself overpowers
him, another, who has been standing on the look-out, comes up
from a distant corner; another stoutly rushes into the m&#234;lée
and cheats his foe now creeping on his prey; another courts blockade
on either flank and under feint of being blocked, himself blocks
two men; another's objective is more ambitious, that he may quickly
break through the massed phalanx, swoop into the lines and, razing
the enemy's rampart, do havoc in the walled stronghold.  Meantime,
although the fight rages fiercely, the hostile ranks are split,
yet thou thyself are victorious with serried lines unbroken or
despoiled maybe of one or two men and both thy hands rattle with
the prisoned throng.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is just possible some of the pieces may have been differentiated
with increased power - some archaeological finds imply pieces in
at least three colors.  These "super-pieces" would have
been the inspiration for the Tafl King.  Dice may have been involved
too - the Romans were avid gamblers.</p>

<h2>SEEGA</h2>

<p>Another clue to how Latrunculi were played is to be found in Egypt
and Somalia, where <b>Seega </b>is still played today.  Remember
that Egypt was within the borders of the Roman Empire and Somalia
just outside.  Seega is played thus:</p>

<p>  Each player has 12 pieces.  A 5x5 board is used.  The game starts
with each player alternating placing two pieces anywhere on the
board except on the central square.  Each square may be occupied
by no more than one piece.  No captures may be made during that
phase.</p>

	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="CENTER">
	A Seega board after all of the players' pieces have been placed
	</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</center><p></p>

<p>  Once all 24 pieces are on the board, all pieces move one space
orthogonally in any direction, as long as the destination square
is empty.  The player who placed the last two stones goes first.</p>

<p>  Enemy pieces are taken by custodial capture -by being sandwiched
between two of one's own pieces along one axis.  Multiple captures
may result from a single move.  A piece may sandwich itself between
enemy pieces without being taken.  A piece on the central square
is safe from capture.  Whenever a player captures an enemy piece,
he may move the capturing piece again if this leads to another
capture.</p>

<p>  If a player is without any possible moves, his opponent must
move again and make an opening for him.  The winner is the player
with the most pieces left on the board once each player has built
an impregnable barrier or a player is wiped out.  Draws are frequent.</p>

<p>Variants are played on 7x7 or 9x9 boards, with each player having
then 24 or 40 pieces.  <b>High Jump </b>is a variant of Seega
where the capture is by jump, just like in Checkers.</p>

<h2>RECONSTRUCTED RULES FOR LATRUNCULI</h2>

<p>  Each player has 16 pieces (black and white).  An 8x7 board is
used, the players sitting with the short distance between them.</p>

<p>  <i>Option: </i>Use an 8x8 board.</p>

<p>  The game starts with each player alternating placing a piece
anywhere on the board.  Each square may be occupied by no more
than one piece.  No captures may be made during that phase.</p>

<p>  <i>Option: </i>Each player starts with his pieces in the two
rows of his end of the board.</p>

<p>  All pieces move one space orthogonally in any direction, as
long as the destination square is empty.</p>

<p>  <i>Option: </i>All pieces move as chess rooks, sliding any number
of spaces orthogonally as long as it doesn't jump over another
piece.</p>

<p>  <i>Further Option: </i>Dice are used to indicate how far the
piece may move.</p>

<p>  Enemy pieces are taken by custodial capture -by being sandwiched
between two of one's own pieces along one axis or by being sandwiched
in a corner of the board between two of one's own pieces.  Multiple
captures may result from a single move.  A piece may sandwich
itself between enemy pieces without being taken.  Whenever a player
captures an enemy piece, he moves again.</p>

<p>  The game ends when a player loses all of his pieces or when
a situation develops where neither player can capture any opposing
piece (within 30 moves).  The winner is then the player with the
most pieces left on the board.</p>

<h3><i>Ducis Variant:</i></h3>

<p>  Each player exchanges two normal pieces for a special piece,
a <i>Dux </i>(blue and yellow, respectively; plural <i>Ducis</i>).</p>
 
<p> The board is now oriented so that the long distance lies between
the players.  The Ducis are placed last.  When using the fixed
set-up, each player's Dux goes in the middle square of the third
row, whilst the second row's extremities are left vacant.</p>

<p></p><center>

	</td>

</tbody></table>
</center><p></p>

<p>  A Dux may <i>jump </i>over a single enemy piece, landing on
an empty square beyond.  This does not constitute a capture unless
the Dux sandwiches an enemy piece between its landing square and
one of its own men.  The Ducis' jumping power allow them to penetrate
a defensive position and possibly start a series of captures from
within a walled stronghold.  Ducis can be captured normally.</p>

<h2>CONSTRUCTION OF AN HNEFATAFL BOARD</h2>

<p>The board I made was designed as a small, portable version.  Wooden
components were obtained from a hobby supply store.  The pegged
pieces of the dark player were stained.  The board had holes drilled
into it, then a grid was outlined in pencil , along with decorations,
before being graven by my Lady.  The engraved lines were then
painted.  A coat of varnish was applied to board and pieces.</p>

<p>A minimal set of rules was glued to the back of the board and
felt pads applied.  Finally, a bag was prepared by my Lady to
contain the game board and pieces.</p>

<p>The decorative pattern of fighting dogs was inspired by Celtic
animal knotwork.</p>

<p>Contrary to what many books say, neither Chess nor <b>Checkers
</b>(a. k. a. <b>Draughts</b>) were commonly played in the early
medieval period.  Chess did not become popular until brought back
by Crusaders after the first Crusade (1096-99) and Checkers was
not played until much later in the medieval period, following
the wave of Arab expansion.  The Lewis chessmen <a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html#2b">[2B]</a>, although
Viking, date to the mid twelfth century.  However, recent excavations
at Dublin and York have revealed playing pieces shaped like Arabic
Chess pieces, but with pre-Conquest style Scandinavian style decoration.</p>
 
<p> It would not be strange if the Vikings, thanks to their trading
contacts with the Arab world (via the Russian route), learnt this
game earlier than other Europeans, although this is just speculation.</p>
 
<p> Chess certainly did not become popular or widespread until the
twelfth century.</p>

<p><a name="2b">[2B]</a> Pendleson, K. R. G., 1980, p. 38.  Other sources also have
good illustrations of this set.</p>

<p><a name="3">[3]</a> Several wooden boards for Tabula are known from the Saxons'
Germanic homeland, and metal fittings for boards of this type
have been found from the Viking Age in Germany and Denmark.  The
only known surviving British example of a Tabula board was found
in Gloucester; dating to the XIth century.  The decorated bone
plates that once covered the now rotted wooden board and the playing
pieces, beautifully carved from bone and antler, can be seen in
the Gloucester city museum.  Playing pieces suitable for this
game are a more common find.</p>

<p><a name="4">[4]</a> Three Men's Morris is a close relative of <b>Tic-Tac-Toe </b>(a.
k. a. <b>Noughts and Crosses</b>).  Once each of the players'
three pieces have been placed, they move one square in any direction
until someone wins by forming a mill (row, column or diagonal
of three pieces).  In a variant, pieces are allowed to jump over
other pieces.  The Romano-Byzantine game of <b>Rota </b>(Latin
for "Wheel") is another close relative.</p>

<p><a name="5">[5]</a> From the earliest times (it was played in Ancient Egypt) Nine
Men's Morris (and its close relatives, <b>Six Men's Morris </b>and
<b>Twelve Men's Morris</b>) has been known as 'the game on the
other side of the board'.  Several boards found in both Viking
and Anglo-Saxon contexts have had Hnefatafl on one side and Nine
Men's Morris on the other.  However the game has also been found
in rather unexpected places -ship's timbers, loose boards, benches,
lumps of rock and, later, even on church pews and tiles.  We do
not know which of the 'Tafl' names was used for this game (Brannan-Tafl
or Hnot-Tafl?), but the word <i>Merels </i>or <i>Merelles </i>(from
the low Latin <i>Merrelus, </i>'a token, counter or coin') is
often used for this game just after Anglo-Saxon times.  The Old
Norse is <i>Mylta, </i>"Mills".</p>

<p><a name="9">[9]</a> Dice were made of antler for the most part, although examples
of bone, walrus ivory and jet are also known.  More perishable
materials, such as wood and horn, were also likely to have been
used.  They were often parallelepipeds, with the 1 and 2 on either
end and the 3, 4, 5 and 6 on the four long sides.  These 'long
dice' are usually found in sets of two or three; it has been suggested
they were used for Tabula (Kvatru-Tafl).</p>

<p>Others types were also found including modern shaped and numbered
examples.  Although the numbers on opposite faces do not always
add up to seven (as on a modern dice), this arrangement is the
most common.  One curious die found in Viking Dublin is a cubic
die that has the number combination of 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6.  Its
use is unknown but it is reminiscent of 'averaging' dice used
in some modern wargaming (where the numbers are 2, 3, 3, 4, 4,
5).</p>

<p>The nature of the games played with dice is unknown, but simple
games such as 'who can get the highest number' were probably common
(and are suggested by some of the sagas), as were games similar
to <b>Liar's Dice </b>and <b>Yahtzee.</b></p>

<p>Another type of gaming piece was made from slices of hart's pedicle
(which must have been taken from a fully grown male deer carcass
since this would not have been available with fallen antler).</p>

<p>In some cases these have been beautifully carved and decorated
and often have a hole in the centre where the porous heart of
the pedicle has been removed.</p>
