SLAYER: downloads
(downloads)
<p>The official releases of SLAYER are available at
<a href="ftp://download.gnu.org.ua/release/slayer">
  ftp://download.gnu.org.ua/release/slayer
</a>. Apart from the source code, the self-contained build for the Windows 
operating system can be obtained from there as well (it includes all
necessary runtime libraries).</p>

<p>Note however, that since SLAYER is a relatively young and quickly
growing project, the official tarballs don't necessarily contain all
the latest improvements, which can be found in the Mercurial repository:</p>

<pre>
  hg clone http://hg.gnu.org.ua/hgweb/slayer
</pre>

<p>The repository is also mirrored by the
<a href="http://bitbucket.org">bitbucket</a> service:</p>

<pre>
  hg clone https://bitbucket.org/panicz/slayer
</pre>

<p>Both services provide a facility to browse the source code online.</p>
