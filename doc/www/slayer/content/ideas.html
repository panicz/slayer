SLAYER: ideas
(ideas)
<p>As a framework, SLAYER is very general and flexible, and it is important
that its extensions don't loose that flexibility.</p>

<p>One of the ideas is to extend the <i>&lt;text-area&gt;</i> widget used in the
"slayer.scm" demo to give it more editing capabilities (especially when it
comes to working with the Scheme sources). It could eventually be regarded as a
multimedia-enabled <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a> that
would be more friendly to newcomers.</p>

<p>Another idea would be to port SLAYER to various environments, like
web browsers (via some of the <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS#wiki-lisp-scheme">Scheme-to-JavaScript</a>
compilers), or to integrate it with some of the implementations like 
<a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/indes/fp/Bigloo/">Bigloo</a>,
<a href="http://www.call-cc.org/">Chicken</a> or
<a href="http://dynamo.iro.umontreal.ca/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Gambit</a>
that generate stand-alone executables.</p>
