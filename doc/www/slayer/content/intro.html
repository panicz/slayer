SLAYER: about
(about SLAYER)
<p>The aim of SLAYER is to deliver a portable environment for developing
3d/multimedia applications in the <a href="http://schemers.org">Scheme</a> 
programming language.</p>

<p>It currently uses the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile">Guile 
Scheme</a> as its base, and is known to work under Linux and Windows
(with the pre-compiled binary version available for the latter).</p>

<p>SLAYER comes bundled with a set of demos that show the spectrum
of its possibilities. You can take a glimpse of them in the
<a href="?page=screenshots">screenshots</a> section, or analyse them
in more details by <a href="?page=downloads">obtaining and running</a>
them.</p>

<p>SLAYER is <a href="http://www.fsf.org">free software</a> and is provided
under the terms of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU 
General Public License</a>.</p>

Note that in order to build SLAYER, you'll need the following libraries
(and their dependencies, of course): 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile">libguile-2.0</a>,
<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php">SDL 1.2</a>,
<a href="https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/release-1.2.html">SDL_image</a>,
<a href="https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/release-1.2.html">SDL_ttf</a>,
and optionally
<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/release-1.2.html">SDL_mixer</a>
and some implementation of <a href="http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a> (with
