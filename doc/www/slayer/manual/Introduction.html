<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>When I was 14, I felt a desperate urge to program computer games. I collected
$25 to buy a book that would teach me programming. It was a huge brick titled
&ldquo;Teach yourself Visual Basic 6.0 in 21 days&rdquo;, and I soon figured out that
I'd need $1000 more to obtain the tools that would allow me to use the
knowledge contained in the book. That I could not afford.

<p>Times have changed a lot since then. Windows 95 is no longer a dictator
on desktop computers, there are many excellent free tools and libraries
for developers (often much better than the proprietary ones), and knowledge
on the Web is available to virtually everyone.

<p>However, many tools are much more difficult to learn than they could be, or
aren't available on as many systems as one could wish. Furthermore, existing
soultions frequently impose many restrictions on the way the things can be done.

<p>SLAYER was conceived to address those issues. It is meant to be an accessible,
portable and extensible multimedia environment that would be suitable for
learning as well as game development and unconventional or highly customizable
GUI/multimedia applications. It uses SDL for portability and is built on top
of Guile Scheme for accessibility and extensibility.

<p>In a way SLAYER can resemble fluxus<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. 
There are however some essential differences between those systems. Fluxus
is intended to work mainly with 3D-graphics, while SLAYER works with 2D
objects just as fine. Fluxus has a built-in editor, while SLAYER is kept
minimalistic and only allows to add an editor widget to the stage, which
perhaps makes it more flexible. (By the way, such widget is already provided
and used in one of the demos.) Also, fluxus is focused on live coding and
sound processing, but there are no good sound processing libraries for SLAYER
yet.

<p>Lastly, SLAYER works with Guile Scheme, and fluxus uses Racket. These are
both Scheme-based languages, but their extensions are incompatible with each
other. They're both cool, though.
