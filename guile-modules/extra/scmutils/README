The files contained in this directory were derived from
http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~gildea/guile-scmutils/
a port of the original scmutils package from MIT/GNU Scheme
to Guile made by Daniel Gildea.
The description how to obtain the original scmutils, created
by Gerald Sussman et al. can be found here:
http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6946/linux-install.htm

The part of scmutils redistributed with SLAYER forms a _very_
small subset of the original package (mainly the code to
perform singular value decomposition)
