This work would never see the daylight without help and support from the GUILE
community, whose comments have always been fruitful for my development in
programming. In particular, I'd like to thank Neil Jerram, who kindly 
explained me the very baiscs of Scheme in my early days; to Ludovic Courtès,
who patiently kept responding to my groundless bug reports; to Andy Wingo, 
whose knowledge and ideas will probably never stop to impress me; to 
Thien-Thi Nguyen, who bears the spirit of a true community maker, and from
whom I learn a lot; to Mark H. Weaver, Ian Price, Mike Gran, Nala Ginrut
and a few others, of whom my fallible memory forgot to mention.

Great thanks to Sergey Pozniakoff for helping out with the inscrutable
GNU build system, running build tests and for standing my whinings regarding
hosting at puszcza.gnu.org.ua. Exchanging thoughts with him has been a source
of pure joy and priceless knowldege.

To Eli Zaretskii, Laura Michaels and Jan Schukat, for helping me 
to build Windows version of SLAYER (including their spiritual support). 
To Mike MacFerrin, for allowing me to use his implementation of glWindowPos* 
function, which was lacking in the library supplied with Windows operating 
system.

Finally, I'd like to thank my dear friends, in particular Ścisław Dercz,
whose spring of creativity has been a constant inspiration for me, and 
Adrian Gruntkowski for his sober insight and concise suggestions.

I believe that this is just a very beginning of the journey, and that there's
so much more to come.
