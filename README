The following programs/libraries are required to accomplish the build process:
- unix build environment (gcc + make + pkg-config + g++)
- guile 2.0 (with headers)
- SDL 1.2 + SDL_image + SDL_ttf + SDL_mixer (with headers)
- OpenGL implementation with headers

If those are provided, just type ./configure && make (or see the INSTALL
file for more details)

If you want to try out some of the demos, enter the "demos"
directory and see the included README file.
