The aim of slayer project is to separate user interface
from program's logics as much as possible, i.e. to allow
user completely redefine user interface, by reassembling
tiny blocks that are provided by application developer.

From the developer's point of view, the idea is to
take away the need of designing user interface from
the developer -- so that the user interfaces could be
generated automatically according to the program 
specification, and then they could be polished by the
user interface designer easily (by adding new widgets,
joining or retouching the existing ones, removing the
redundant ones)

The end-user could still be allowed to break the GUI
apart and then reassemble it according to his or her
needs.

Slayer could also be thought of as a platform to develop
automatic user interface generator that would adjust to
the user's preferences.

Currently, slayer is implemented by combining the SDL
library ( http://www.libsdl.org ) with the GNU guile
scripting language (a flavour of the Scheme programming
language, http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/ ).
