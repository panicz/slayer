The following programs/libraries are required to accomplish the build process:
- unix build environment (gcc + make + pkg-config + g++)
- guile 2.0 (with headers)
- SDL 1.2 + SDL_image + SDL_ttf + SDL_mixer (with headers)
- OpenGL implementation with headers

Optionally, slayer can be compiled without OpenGL or SDL_mixer, which
currently requires editing Makefile by hand -- one needs to remove the 
-DUSE_OPENGL and -DUSE_SDL_MIXER options from CFLAGS

In order to build slayer, provided the above condition are met, 
one simply has to type:

  $ make

Once the program is built, it can be run using the following command
(in the main directory):

  $ ./slayer -e3d

The above command tells slayer to load the 3d (OpenGL) extension,
which is required by the slayer.scm file from the repository. The
slayer.scm is a tiny 3D demo which is controlled using mouse and 
WSAD keys.

As an example, there is a demo of the classical PONG game, which
can be run using

  $ ./slayer -i pong.scm

or alternatively

  $ ./slayer --input pong.scm

Should anything be wrong with the audio driver, it is possible to
bypass the audio system using the --nosound option:

  $ ./slayer -i pong.scm --nosound

However, rather than watching various demos, you are encouraged to read
the source code and to implement your own ideas.
