The following supplement programs need to be done
before the game can be finished:

- a robot editor, that allows to join various
shapes (adjusting their size and other parameters) 
using specified joints, adjusting their parameters
as well [perhaps you could think about using
Russell Smith's ODE, instead of reinventing the
wheel]

- a pose editor, that allows to come up with
new poses that could later be recalled by the
actual code. such editor would enable to:
- set certain joints in a given position
- release constrains on another joints
(so they can be either loosen or left as they
were in a previous pose)
- among other joints, there is the horizon
that can be set accurately

- a map editor

a pose is a function of joints and time/energy
that should be applied in order to get to a
given pose

(define-move (walk energy)
  (pose 'stand-straight energy)
  (pose 'left-leg-lift energy)
  (pose 'left-leg-lean
